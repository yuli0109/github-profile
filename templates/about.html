      has prepared me adaptability to different place and people ,
      learning skill to master unfamiliar knowledge and cooperation with teammates

    <p class="about-paragraph">I taught myself Pascal(an ancient programming language) when I was in high school,
    then I kept learning few other programming languages such as C and C++ in college.
    I like new things in our lives. Like Javascript which is one of the fastest growing programming language and still improving everyday now.
    Some unique features of Javascript like dynamically typed and first-class functions are so brillant that attract me to be a Javascript programmer.
